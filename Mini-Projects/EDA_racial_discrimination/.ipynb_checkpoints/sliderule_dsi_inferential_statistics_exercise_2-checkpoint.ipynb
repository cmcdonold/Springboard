    "# Examining Racial Discrimination in the US Job Market\n",
    "\n",
    "### Background\n",
    "Racial discrimination continues to be pervasive in cultures throughout the world. Researchers examined the level of racial discrimination in the United States labor market by randomly assigning identical résumés to black-sounding or white-sounding names and observing the impact on requests for interviews from employers.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data\n",
    "In the dataset provided, each row represents a resume. The 'race' column has two values, 'b' and 'w', indicating black-sounding and white-sounding. The column 'call' has two values, 1 and 0, indicating whether the resume received a call from employers or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the 'b' and 'w' values in race are assigned randomly to the resumes when presented to the employer."

    "### Exercises\n",
    "You will perform a statistical analysis to establish whether race has a significant impact on the rate of callbacks for resumes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer the following questions **in this notebook below and submit to your Github account**. \n",
    "\n",
    "   1. What test is appropriate for this problem? Does CLT apply?\n",
    "   2. What are the null and alternate hypotheses?\n",
    "   3. Compute margin of error, confidence interval, and p-value. Try using both the bootstrapping and the frequentist statistical approaches.\n",
    "   4. Write a story describing the statistical significance in the context or the original problem.\n",
    "   5. Does your analysis mean that race/name is the most important factor in callback success? Why or why not? If not, how would you amend your analysis?\n",

    "<p><b>Answer:</b> Both the frequentist and bootstrapping analysis resulted in a very low p-value for the null hypothesis, which means that we must reject the null hypothesis that there is no difference in the percentage of callbacks between applicants with white-sounding names and black-sounding names. As a result, we must conclude that there is indeed a statistically significant difference between the percentage of callbacks between white-sounding and black-sounding names. This analysis presents strong evidence of racial discrimination in the US labor market, as the dataset was specifically designed to remove other potential factors in callback rate by presenting identical resumes for both groups.</p>\n",

    "<p><b>Answer:</b> The analysis indicates that race certainly is a factor that effects callback success, but we cannot claim that it is the <i>most important</i> factor in callback success because we have not analyzed the other potential factors. In order to make such a claim, we would need to account for other potential factors (i.e. education, years of experience, previous number of jobs, gender, location, managerial experience, etc) and compare the effects.</p>\n",
